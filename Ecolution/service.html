        <p>There's nothing quite like buying a new electronic gadget. The thrill of unboxing it and using it for the
            first time.

            Most of us upgrade to newer, better electronic devices but often fail to recycle the existing gadgets in an
            environment-friendly manner.

            However, it's essential to dispose of old tech responsibly. E-Waste is not only a dust collector at home but
            also could be dangerous.

            R2 PRO picks up all kinds of ewaste directly from the customer location.</p>

                <p>Solar trash compactors are powered by solar energy and are thus associated
                     with significant advantages of energy savings and reduction of carbon footprint.
                      This is attracting investments from governments for the development of public infrastructure,
                       which, in turn, is triggering market development.</p> -->
